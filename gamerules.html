The start of the game<br>
Everyone starts in the secret room.  
All the players will roll for the highest number. The highest number gets the board to face them and place Elianno anywhere on the board.  The 2nd highest goes first, the third highest goes 2nd and so on with the player with the highest roll going last. 
Players will take turns until the first one that crosses paths with Elianno becoming the winner!<br><br><br>
